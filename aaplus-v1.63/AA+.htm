<p>Welcome to <strong>AA+</strong>, a collection of freeware C++ classes which provide 
an implementation of the algorithms as presented in the book &quot;Astronomical 
Algorithms&quot; (2nd Edition) by Jean Meeus.</p>
<p>Example areas covered include the positions of the planets, comets, minor planets 
and the moon, calculation of times of Rising, Setting and Transit, calculation of 
times of Equinoxes and Solstices plus calculation of the positions of the moons 
of Jupiter and Saturn as well as many other algorithms presented in the book.</p>

<h2><a name="History"></a>History</h2>
<p><strong>V1.0 (6 February 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Initial public release.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.01 (9 February 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the values used in the calculation of the a1 and a2 constants for 
	Saturn&#39;s moon Rhea (satellite V) following an email from Jean Meeus confirming 
	that these constants are indeed incorrect as published in the book. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.02 (9 February 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>V1.04 (21 February 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>The optical libration in longitude for the moon is now returned in the range

</ul>
<p><strong>V1.05 (22 February 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the calculation of the phase type from the k value in CAAMoonPhases::TruePhase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.06 (22 February 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Calculation of semi durations for eclipses in CAAEclipses is now calculated 
	only when required</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>27 April&nbsp; 2004</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minor update to the documentation describing CAAElliptical::MeanMotionFromSemiMajorAxis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.07 (24 May 2004)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a missing break statement in CAAElliptical::Calculate. Thanks to Carsten 
	A. Arnholm for reporting this bug.</li>
	<li>Also fixed an issue with the calculation of the apparent distance to the 
	Sun.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.08 (31 May 2004)</strong></p>

	Again thanks to Brian Orme for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>In CAASaturn::EclipticLongitude the g_L5SaturnCoefficients[] were not included. 
	Thanks to Brian Orme for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>In CAASaturn::EclipticLatitude the g_B5SaturnCoefficients[] were not included. 
	Thanks to Brian Orme for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>In CAASaturn::RadiusVector the g_R5SaturnCoefficients[] were not included.

</ul>
<p><strong>v1.09 (15 June 2004)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a typo in the calculation of SunLongDash in CAAPhysicalSun::Calculate. 
	Thanks to Brian Orme for spotting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6 September 2004</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minor update to the documentation plus a full spell check!!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.10 (17 September 2004)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a number of warnings in the code when compiled in VC .Net 2003 with 
	the &quot;Force conformance in For Loop Scope&quot; compiler option is set.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.11 (15 October 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>bValid variable is now correctly set in CAARiseTransitSet::Rise if the objects 
	does actually rise and sets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.12 (10 November 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix for CAADate::Get so that it works correctly for propalactive calendar 
	dates. The Meeus implementation automatically assumes the Gregorian Calendar 
	came into effect on 15 October 1582 (JD: 2299161), while the CAADate implementation 
	has a &quot;m_bGregorianCalendar&quot; value to decide if the date was specified 
	in the Gregorian or Julian Calendars. This difference means in effect that CAADate 
	fully supports propalactive versions of both calendar systems. This problem 
	was discovered when testing the Moslem calendar code which involves a round 
	trip between Moslem -&gt; Julian -&gt; Gregorian calendars. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.13 (31 December 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix for CAAElliptical::MinorPlanetMagnitude where the phase angle was being 
	incorrectly converted from Radians to Degress when it was already in degrees. 
	Thanks to Martin Burri for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.14 (21 January 2005)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a small but important error in the function PhaseAngle(r, R, Delta). 
	The code was producing incorrect results and raises acos DOMAIN errors and floating 
	point exceptions when calculating phase angles for the inner planets. Thanks 
	to MICHAEL R. MEYER for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.15 (30 January 2005)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Replaced all usage of BOOL with bool to aid in cross compiler compatibility. 
	This also means that all occurrences of TRUE and FALSE are replaced with true 
	and false respectively. Thanks to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this issue.
	</li>
	<li>cmath header file is now used rather than math.h. Also if now does not use 
	the #pragma message text based on a define which is MS C specific. Again thanks 
	to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this issue. </li>
	<li>Now uses asssert instead of the MFC specific ASSERT. Again thanks to Mika 
	Heiskanen for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Addition of a new global header file &quot;AA+.h&quot; which allows you 
	to include all of the AA+ framework through one header.</li>
	<li>Code now use static_cast&#39;s rather than old C-style casts. Again thanks 
	to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Optimized some of the code in assert&#39;s which avoid unitialized variables 
	when build in release mode. Again thanks to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this 
	issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.16 (31 January 2005)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CAAParabolic::Calculate where the JD value was being used 
	incorrectly in the loop. Thanks to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>Fixed a GCC warning in CAADynamicalTime::DeltaT. Thanks to Mika Heiskanen 
	for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>Fixed a GCC compiler error related to missing include for memset in AAEclipses.cpp. 
	Thanks to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.17 (1 February 2005)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a case sensitivity problem (at least on Unix systems) related to the 
	stdafx.h/cpp files. Now filename is all lowercase. Thanks to Mika Heiskanen 
	for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>Change the ordering of items in stdafx.h so that you get a clean compile 
	on gcc. Thanks to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem with the declaration of the variable &quot;Index&quot; in 
	the function CAADynamicalTime::DeltaT. Thanks to Mika Heiskanen for reporting 
	this problem.</li>
	<li>Removed usage of MFC from sample app as it is not required.</li>
	<li>Verfied the building of the code on GCC thro the use of Cygwin&#39;s port 
	of GCC.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.18 (21 April 2005)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Renamed &quot;AAAberation.cpp&quot; to &quot;AAAberration.cpp&quot; so that 
	all source code filenames match their corresponding header files. Thanks to 
	Jürgen Schuck for suggesting this update.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.19 (13 May 2005)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix for CAADate::Set(double JD, bool bGregorianCalendar) not setting the 
	m_bGregorianCalendar member variable correctly. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.20 (2 June 2005)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Seems the case sensitivity issue fixed in v1.17 was not fixed because I 
	forgot to update the files in the zip download. Thanks to Andrew Maclean for 
	reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>A &quot;CMakeLists.txt&quot; file is now included in the download. This 
	file is used by CMake (<a href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Index.html">http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Index.html</a>) 
	which is a cross-platform makefile generator. This allows the AA+ code to be 
	easily compiled on Cygwin, Linux and the usual MSVC compilers. Thanks to Andrew 
	Maclean for this nice addition.</li>
	<li>Some of the functions in the class &quot;CAACoordinateTransformation&quot; 
	have been made inline to improve performance.</li>
	<li>Made all structures used by AA+ classes. This is a minor tidy up issue more 
	than anything. Also ensured all class members are initialized to sane defaults.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.21 (3 June 2005)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minor update to &quot;CMakeLists.txt&quot; file to fix a case sensitivity 
	issue. Thanks to Andrew Maclean for reporting this issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.22 (5 July 2005)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix for a bug to ensure that values returned from CAAEquationOfTime::Calculate 
	does not return discontinuities. Instead it now returns negative values when 
	required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.23 (16 November 2005)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a transcription error in the second coefficient used to calculate 
	the longitude of Mercury. Thanks to &quot;Maurizio&quot; for reporting this 
	bug.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1 May 2006</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>While testing v3.01 of <a href="http://www.naughter.com/dtimeplus.html">
	DTime+</a> I discovered some bugs in the CAAMoslemCalendar class. Specifically 
	testing some dates by creating a Moslem date, then converting to a Julian date 
	and then converting back to the Moslem calendar highlighted some dates which 
	fail this roundtrip test. If you are serious about developing for the Moslem 
	calendar, then please use the Moslem calendar support in
	<a href="http://www.naughter.com/dtimeplus.html">DTime+</a> which uses an independent 
	algorithm for the Moslem calendar which does not have this problem. I will report 
	this issue to Jean Meeus and possibly have a fix for it in the next update to 
	AA+.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.24 (12 May 2006)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the documentation to use the same style as the web site.</li>
	<li>Fixed a transcription error in the third coefficient used to calculate the 
	R0 term for the radius vector of Mercury. Thanks to John Kruso for reporting 
	this issue.</li>
	<li>Fixed a transcription error in the third coefficient used to calculate the 
	R1 term for the radius vector of Mercury. Thanks to John Kruso for reporting 
	this issue.</li>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>18 May 2006</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Jean Meeus has confirmed that there is definitely a bug in the Moslem calendar 
	algorithms which make up the CAAMoslemCalendar class. He is not the original 
	author of these algorithms, so he was unable to explain why they fail for some 
	dates. As previously mentioned please use the
	<a href="http://www.naughter.com/dtimeplus.html">DTime+</a> classes to avoid 
	this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.25 (5 June 2006)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CAAElliptical::Calculate(double JD, EllipticalObject object) 
	where the correction for nutation was incorrectly using the Mean obliquity of 
	the ecliptic instead of the true value. The results from the test program now 
	agree much more closely with the example Meeus provides which is the position 
	of Venus on 1992 Dec. 20 at 0h Dynamical Time. I&#39;ve also checked the positions 
	against the JPL Horizons web site and the agreement is much better. Because 
	the True obliquity of the Ecliptic is defined as the mean obliquity of the ecliptic 
	plus the nutation in obliquity, it is relatively easy to determine the magnitude 
	of error this was causing. From the chapter on Nutation in the book, and specifically 
	the table which gives the cosine coefficients for nutation in obliquity you 
	can see that the absolute worst case error would be the sum of the absolute 
	values of all of the coefficients and would have been c. 10 arc seconds of degree, 
	which is not a small amount!. This value would be an absolute worst case and 
	I would expect the average error value to be much much smaller (probably much 
	less than an arc second). Anyway the bug has now been fixed. Thanks to Patrick 
	Wong for pointing out this rather significant bug. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>23 October 2006</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minor update to fix some incorrect book mark links in the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.26 (29 November 2006)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where CAAEclipticalElements::Calculate and CAAEclipticalElements::FK4B1950ToFK5J2000 
	would return the incorrect value for the reduced inclination when the initial 
	inclination value was &gt; 90 degrees.</li>
	<li>Addition of a new module called CAANearParabolic. This new class provides 
	functionality for orbits which can be best modelled as near parabolic i.e. where 
	the eccentricity is between 0.98 and 1.02. Chapter 35 in the book includes support 
	for calculating Near-parabolic orbits, but the code is provided in BASIC and 
	the algorithm as presented has problems converging when the eccentricity is 
	close to 1. Instead the algorithms used in this new module are based upon the 
	worked examples which Paul Schlyter has provided at
	<a href="http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html#16">http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html#16.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.27 (17 January 2007)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>Addition of a AAPLUS_EXT_CLASS preprocessor macro to allow the code to be 
	more easily added to an extension DLL. Thanks to Mathieu Peyréga for suggesting 
	this update.</li>
	<li>Changed name of CAASun::ApparentEclipticLongtitude to CAASun::ApparentEclipticLongitude. 
	Thanks to Mathieu Peyréga for reporting this typo!.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.28 (25 January 2007)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a minor compliance issue with GCC in the AACoordinateTransformation.h 
	to do with the declaration of various methods. Thanks to Mathieu Peyréga for 
	reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.29 (26 January 2007)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>After a bug report from Ing. Taras Kapuszczak that a round trip of the date 
	25 January 100 as specified in the Gregorian calendar to the Julian day number 
	and then back again produces the incorrect date 26 January 100, I&#39;ve spent 
	some time looking into the 2 key Meeus Julian Day algorithms. It seems that 
	the algorithms which converts from a Calendar date to JD works ok for propalactive 
	dates, but the reverse algorithm which converts from a JD to a Calendar date 
	does not. Since I made the change in behaviour to support propalactive Gregorian 
	dates to address issues with the Moslem calendar (and since then I have discovered 
	further unresolved bugs in the Moslem calendar algorithms and advised people 
	to check out my <a href="http://www.naughter.com/dtimeplus.html">DTime+</a> 
	library instead), I am now reverting these changes so that the date algorithms 
	are now as presented in Meeus&#39;s book. This means that dates after 15 October 
	1582 are assumed to be in the Gregorian calendar and dates before are assumed 
	to be in the Julian calendar. This change also means that some of the CAADate 
	class methods no longer require the now defunct &quot;bool&quot; parameter to 
	specify which calendar the date represents. As part of the testing for this 
	release verification code has been added to AATest.cpp to test all the dates 
	from JD 0 (i.e. 1 January -4712) to a date long in the future. Hopefully with 
	this verification code, we should have no more reported issues with the class 
	CAADate. Again if you would prefer a much more robust and comprehensive Date 
	time class framework, don&#39;t forget to check out the authors
	<a href="http://www.naughter.com/dtimeplus.html">DTime+</a> library.</li>
	<li>Optimized CAADate constructor code </li>
	<li>Provided a static version of CAADate::DaysInMonth() method</li>
	<li>Discovered an issue in CAADate::JulianToGregorian. It seems the algorithm 
	presented in the book to do conversion from the Julian to Gregorian calendar 
	fails for Julian dates before the Gregorian calendar reform in 1582. I have 
	sent an email to Jean Meeus to find out if this is a bug in my code or a deficiency 
	in the algorithm presented. Currently the code will assert in this function 
	if it is called for a date before the Gregorian reform.</li>
	<li>Changed name of CAAMoonIlluminatedFraction::IluminatedFraction to CAAMoonIlluminatedFraction::IlluminatedFraction. 
	Thanks to Ing. Taras Kapuszczak for reporting this typo!.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.30 (29 January 2007)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The static version of the CAADate::Set method has been renamed to DateToJD 
	to avoid any confusion with the other Set methods. Thanks to Ing. Taras Kapuszczak 
	for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>The method CAADate::InGregorianCalendar has now also been renamed to the 
	more appropriate CAADate::AfterPapalReform.</li>
	<li>Reinstated the bGregorianCalendar parameter for the CAADate constructors 
	and Set methods.</li>
	<li>Changed the parameter layout for the static version of CAADate::DaysInMonth</li>
	<li>Addition of a CAADate::InGregorianCalendar method.</li>
	<li>Addition of a CAADate::SetInGregorianCalendar method.</li>
	<li>Reworked implementation of GregorianToJulian method.</li>
	<li>Reworked implementation of JulianToGregorian method.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.31 (26 July 2008)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Changed name of CAASun::EclipticRectangularCoordinatesMeanEquinox to CAASun::EquatorialRectangularCoordinatesMeanEquinox 
	to refer to the fact that it returns equatorial coordinates instead of ecliptic 
	coordinates. Thanks to Frank Trautmann for reporting this issue</li>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>zip file now ships with a VC 2005 solution instead of a VC 6 solution file.</li>
	<li>Code now compiles cleanly using Code Analysis (/analyze)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.32 (11 November 2008)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CAAElliptical::Calculate(double JD, const CAAEllipticalObjectElements&amp; 
	elements) in the calculation of the heliocentric rectangular ecliptical, the 
	heliocentric ecliptical latitude and the heliocentric ecliptical longitude coordinates. 
	The code incorrectly used the value &quot;omega&quot; instead of &quot;w&quot; 
	in its calculation of the value &quot;u&quot;. Unfortunately there is no worked 
	examples in Jean Meeus&#39;s book for these particular values, hence resulting 
	in my coding errors. Thanks to Carsten A. Arnholm for reporting this bug.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.33 (7 February 2009)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a seemingly copy and paste bug in CAAMoonPerigeeApogee::TruePerigee. 
	The layout of the code to accumulate the &quot;Sigma&quot; value was incorrect. 
	The terms involving T (e.g. +0.00019*T, -0.00013*T etc were adding these terms 
	to the argument of the sin incorrectly. With the bug fixed the worked example 
	50.a from the book gives: 2447442.3543003569 JDE or 1988 October 7 at 20h:30m:11.5 
	seconds. The previous buggy code was giving the same value of 2447442.3543003569, 
	but this would be the case because T was a small value in the example. You would 
	expect the error in the calculated to be bigger as the date departs from the 
	Epoch 2000.0. Thanks to Neoklis Kyriazis for reporting this bug.</li>
	<li>Optimized the layout of the MoonCoefficient1 structure in the AAMoon.cpp 
	module by making all elements integers instead of doubles.</li>
	<li>Optimized the layout of the PlutoCoefficient1 structure in the AAPluto.cpp 
	module by making all elements integers instead of doubles.</li>
	<li>Updated the static version of CAADate::DaysInMonth to compile cleanly using 
	code analysis.</li>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.34 (12 February 2009)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a seemingly copy and paste bug in CAAMoon::EclipticLongitude. The 
	layout of the code to calculate the &quot;ThisSigma&quot; value was incorrect. 
	The terms involving any value of M was being multiplied by E. This was incorrect 
	as documented at the bottom of page 338 from the second edition of Meeus&#39;s 
	book. The correct logic is to multiple only terms which involve +1M or -1M by 
	E and to multiple any terms which involved 2M or -2M by E*E. With the bug fixed 
	the worked example 47.a from the book now gives: 133.16726428105474 degrees. 
	This is a much closer result to the value as reported in the book which is 133.167265. 
	The previous buggy code was giving the value of 133.16726382897039 degrees for 
	the Moons apparent Longitude. The error in this example is 0.001627 arc seconds 
	of a degree. This error value is well within the actual reported accuracy of 
	10 arc seconds for the code, but you would expect this error to increase as 
	the eccentricity of earths orbit increases. Thanks to Neoklis Kyriazis for reporting 
	this bug.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.35 (16 March 2009)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CAAParabolic::Calculate(double JD, const CAAParabolicObjectElements&amp; 
	elements) in the calculation of the heliocentric rectangular ecliptical, the 
	heliocentric ecliptical latitude and the heliocentric ecliptical longitude coordinates. 
	The code incorrectly used the value &quot;omega&quot; instead of &quot;w&quot; 
	in its calculation of the value &quot;u&quot;. Unfortunately there is no worked 
	examples in Jean Meeus&#39;s book for these particular values, hence resulting 
	in my coding errors. Thanks to Jay Borseth for reporting this bug.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CAANearParabolic::Calculate(double JD, const CAANearParabolicObjectElements&amp; 
	elements) in the calculation of the heliocentric rectangular ecliptical, the 
	heliocentric ecliptical latitude and the heliocentric ecliptical longitude coordinates. 
	The code incorrectly used the value &quot;omega&quot; instead of &quot;w&quot;

	in my coding errors. Thanks to Jay Borseth for reporting this bug.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.36 (28 March 2009)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CAARiseTransitSet::Rise where the cyclical nature of a RA 
	value was not taken into account during the interpolation. In fact Meeus in 
	the book even refers to this issue as &quot;Important remarks, 2.&quot; on page 
	30 of the second edition. Basically when interpolating RA, we need to be careful 
	that the 3 values are consistent with respect to each other when any one of 
	them wraps around from 23H 59M 59S around to 0H 0M 0S. In this case, the RA 
	has increased by 0H 0M 1S of RA instead of decreasing by 23H 59M 59S. Thanks 
	to Corky Corcoran and Danny Flippo for both reporting this issue. </li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the calculation of the parameter &quot;H&quot; in CAARiseTransitSet::Rise 
	when calculating the local hour angle of the body for the time of transit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.37 (30 April 2009)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the M values in CAARiseTransitSet::Rise were not being 
	constrained to between 0 and 1. Thanks to Matthew Yager for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.38 (3 October 2009)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a copy and paste gremlin in the CAAEarth::EclipticLatitude method 
	where it incorrectly used B2, B3 &amp; B4 coefficient terms for Venus. Due to 
	how this bug occurred, the magnitude of the error from it would increase as 
	the date deviated from the year 2000. Thanks to Isaac Salzman for reporting 
	this bug. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.39 (24 November 2009)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the sample app and documentation to provide better guidance on how 
	to calculate the times of Moon rise, transit and set. Thanks to Mehmet Rauf 
	Geden for reporting this bug.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.40 (30 December 2009)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the sample app to pull in cstdio instead of cstdio.h. Thanks to 
	Hugo Mildenberger for suggesting this update.</li>
	<li>Fixed a number of GCC compiler warnings in AATest.cpp. Thanks to Hugo Mildenberger 
	for suggesting this update.</li>
	<li>The CMake file &quot;CMakeLists.txt&quot; included in the download has been 
	updated to work correctly on Gentoo Linux. Again thanks to Hugo Mildenberger 
	for this update.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.41 (10 May 2010)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>Minor update to CAAPhysicalMoon::CalculateTopocentric to put a value in 
	a variable for easier debugging</li>
	<li>Fixed up unused variable warnings in AATest.cpp</li>
	<li>Fixed spelling mistakes in AATest.cpp for &quot;Palomor Observatory&quot;</li>
	<li>The CAAEllipticalObjectDetails::AstrometricGeocenticRA value is now known 
	as AstrometricGeocentricRA. Thanks to Scott Marley for reporting this spelling 
	mistake</li>
	<li>The CAANearParabolicObjectDetails::AstrometricGeocenticRA value is now known 
	as AstrometricGeocentricRA. Thanks to Scott Marley for reporting this spelling 
	mistake</li>
	<li>Removed the unused Delta parameter from the CAANutation::NutationInDeclination 
	method. Thanks to Thomas Meyer for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.42 (21 May 2010)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed spelling mistakes in AATest.cpp for &quot;Palomar Observatory&quot;. 
	Thanks to Leighton Paul for reporting the fact that the change for v1.41 was 
	still spelt incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.43 (3 July 2010)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the g_MoonPerigeeApogeeCoefficients3 table. The &quot;+0.013*cos(4D 
	- 2F)&quot; term was incorrectly using &quot;+0.013*cos(4D - 20F)&quot;. The 
	error in the lunar distance because of this coding error is of the order of 
	1 to 2 KM. Thanks to Thomas Meyer for reporting this bug.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the g_MoonPerigeeApogeeCoefficients1 table. The &quot;D+2M-0.0010&quot; 
	term was incorrectly using &quot;D+2M-0.0011&quot;. Thanks to Thomas Meyer for 
	reporting this bug.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.44 (4 July 2010)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed various compiler warnings and errors when the code is compiled using 
	C++ Builder. Thanks to Neil Bingham for reporting these issues.</li>
	<li>Removed unnecessary &quot;Longitude&quot; parameter from method CAAParallax::Ecliptic2Topocentric.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.45 (26 November 2010)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>CAARefraction::RefractionFromApparent now returns a constant refraction 
	value for all altitudes below a certain limit. Thanks to mehrzad khoddam for 
	prompting this update. </li>
	<li>CAARefraction::RefractionFromTrue now returns a constant refraction value 
	for all altitudes below a certain limit. Thanks to mehrzad khoddam for prompting 
	this update. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.46 (8 May 2011)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>Fixed a compilation issue on GCC where size_t was undefined in various methods. 
	Thanks to Carsten A. Arnholm and Andrew Hammond for reporting this bug.</li>
	<li>Updated CAARiseTransitSet::Rise method to return information for circumpolar 
	object rather than returning bValid = false for this type of object. In the 
	case of a circumpolar object, the object does not rise or set on the day in 
	question but will of course transit at a specific time. This change means that 
	you do not need to recall the method with a declination value to get the transit 
	time. In addition if an object never rises or sets, the method will still return 
	the transit time even though it occurs below the horizon by setting the bTransitAboveHorizon 
	value to false. Note that this means that the &quot;Transit&quot; value will 
	now always include a valid value. Also the method has been renamed to Calculate. 
	Thanks to Andrew Hood for prompting this update </li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CAAGalileanMoons::CalculateHelper where the periodic terms 
	in longitude for the four satellites (Sigma1 to Sigma4) were not being converted 
	to radians prior to some trigonometric calculations. Thanks to Thomas Meyer 
	for reporting this bug.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.47 (10 September 2011)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the calculation of the &quot;F&quot; local variable which 
	represents the Moon&#39;s argument of latitude in the CAAMoonPhases::TruePhase 
	method. Thanks to Andrew Hammond for reporting this bug.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.48 (18 March 2012)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>All global &quot;g_*&quot; tables are now const. Thanks to Roger Dahl for 
	reporting this issue when compiling AA+ on ARM. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.49 (1 May 2012)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated CAADynamicalTime::DeltaT to use new polynomical expressions from 
	Espenak &amp; Meeus 2006. References used:
	<a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/deltatpoly.html">http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/deltatpoly.html</a> 
	and <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/deltat/deltat_old.htm">
	http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/deltat/deltat_old.htm</a> (Espenak &amp; 
	Meeus 2006 section). Thanks to Murphy Chesney for prompting this update.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.50 (2 May 2012)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>To further improve the accuracy of the CAADynamicalTime::DeltaT method, 
	the code now uses a lookup table between the dates of 1 February 1973 to 1 April 
	2012 (for observed values) and predicted values from April 2012 till April 2015. 
	These values are as provided by IERS Rapid Service/Prediction Center at
	<a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data">http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data</a> 
	and <a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.preds">http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.preds</a>. 
	This lookup table will of course need to be kept up to date as IERS update this 
	information. As currently coded there is a single discontinuity of c. one second 
	in early April 2015. At this point
	<a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.preds">http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.preds</a> 
	indicates an error value for DeltaT of about 0.9 seconds anyway. </li>
	<li>A new CAADynamicalTime::CumulativeLeapSeconds has been provided. This method 
	takes as input the Julian Day value and returns the cumulative total of Leap 
	seconds which have been applied to this point. For more information about leap 
	seconds please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second</a>. 
	Using this method you can now implement code which converts from Terrestrial 
	Time to Coordinated Universal time as follows: <br><br><code>double TerrestialTime 
	= some calculation using AA+ algorithms(JD); <br>double DeltaT = CAADynamicalTime::DeltaT(JD);
	<br>double UniversalTime1 = TerrestialTime - DeltaT/86400.0; //The time of the 
	event using the UT1 time scale <br>double TerrestialAtomicTime = TerrestialTime 
	- (32.184/86400.0); //The time of the event using the TAI time scale <br>double 
	CumulativeLeapSeconds = CAADynamicalTime::CumulativeLeapSeconds(JD); <br>double 
	CoordinatedUniversalTime = (DeltaT - CumulativeLeapSeconds - 32.184)/86400.0 
	+ UniversalTime1; //The time of the event using the UTC time scale</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.51 (5 May 2012)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the sample app to print out the rise transit and set times for the 
	Moon and Sun as well as a ASCII graphic of the moon phase for the month of April 
	2012 for the location of Wexford, Ireland. Thanks to Roger Dahl for providing 
	this nice addition to AA+.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.52 (12 October 2012)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Refactored the code in CAARiseTransitSet::Calculate. </li>
	<li>Added comments to the documentation for CAARiseTransitSet::Calculate on 
	the potential for returning times outside of the UTC date requested. Thanks 
	to Rob Phillips for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.53 (13 October 2012)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the sample app to show the rise, transit and set details for the 
	Moon and Sun at the North Pole for 31 October 2012. This shows that the Sun 
	does not rise or set on that day and transits below the horizon at 11:43:36 
	UTC and the Moon also does not rise or set and transits above the horizon at 
	00:35:12 UTC. Thanks to Michael Iverson for prompting this check.</li>
	<li>Removed need for std::string class from AATest.cpp module.</li>
	<li>Fixed a small typo in the AARiseTransitSet.cpp history comments. Thanks 
	to Michael Iverson for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Fixed a typo in the spelling of Coefficient throughout the AADynamicalTime.cpp 
	module. Thanks to Michael Iverson for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.54 (27 October 2012)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a buffer initialization bug in PrintMoonPhase function in AAAtest.cpp. 
	This was resulting in the moon phase ASCII diagrams to not show correctly on 
	Unix terminals.</li>
	<li>I now have a Ubuntu 12.10 VM setup which allows the code to be fully tested 
	on a Unix OS going forward. I am using the Code::Blocks IDE to provide a familiar 
	development experience for this Visual Studio veteran!</li>
	<li>Fixed a transcription bug in CAAElementsPlanetaryOrbit::SaturnLongitudePerihelion. 
	The correct coefficient for multiplying by T should have been 1.9637613 instead 
	of 1.19637613. In the worked example of 31.a from Meeus&#39;s book, he uses 
	the date June 24 2065. With this bug now eliminated the value returned is now 
	94.34 degrees instead of 93.84 degrees for this date. Basically the incorrect 
	coefficient would have returned a value too small by 0.77 degrees for every 
	Julian century after the epoch J2000.0 = 2000 January 1.5 TD = JDE 2451545.0. 
	Thanks to Sudhakar Gumparthi for reporting this bug. </li>

	<li>Fixed a transcription error in the twenty first coefficient used to calculate 
	the L0 term for the ecliptic longitude of Earth. Thanks to Isaac Clark for reporting 
	this issue.</li>

	the R1 term for the ecliptic radius vector of Jupiter. Thanks to Isaac Clark 
	for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Fixed a transcription error in the twenty ninth coefficient used to calculate 
	the B2 term for the ecliptic latitude of Saturn. Thanks to Isaac Clark for reporting 
	this issue. Spot tests indicate that this change only affected the ecliptic 
	latitude in the twelfth decimal place. </li>
	<li>Fixed a transcription error in the second coefficient used to calculate 
	the B0 term for the ecliptic latitude of Neptune. Thanks to Isaac Clark for 
	reporting this issue. Spot tests indicate that this change only affected the 
	ecliptic latitude in the sixth decimal place. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.56 (8 September 2013)</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>v1.57 (28 October 2013)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Renamed the method CAAEquinoxesAndSolstices::SpringEquinox to NorthwardEquinox 
	to avoid the northern hemisphere bias in the name. Thanks to Marius Gleeson 
	for prompting this update. </li>
	<li>Renamed the method CAAEquinoxesAndSolstices::AutumnEquinox to SouthwardEquinox 
	to avoid the northern hemisphere bias in the name. Thanks to Marius Gleeson

	for prompting this update. </li>
	<li>Renamed the method CAAEquinoxesAndSolstices::WinterSolstice to SouthernSolstice 
	to avoid the northern hemisphere bias in the name. Thanks to Marius Gleeson 
	for prompting this update. </li>
	<li>The method CAAEquinoxesAndSolstices::LengthOfSpring now takes a boolean 
	to indicate which hemisphere the observer is located in. Previously the code 
	assumed a northern hemisphere bias. Thanks to Marius Gleeson for prompting this 
	update. </li>

	to 1st September 2013.</li>
	<li>Addition of a CAADynamicalTime::UT1MinusUTC method which returns UT1 - UTC.
	</li>
	<li>Fixed a number of GCC compiler warnings in AATest.cpp.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.58 (12 November 2014)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details. </li>
	<li>Fixed two transcription bugs in the CAAPrecession::PrecessEquatorial method. 
	The&quot;0.000344*T&quot; term was incorrectly using &quot;0.0000344*T&quot; 
	when calculating &quot;sigma&quot; and the &quot;0.000139*Tsquared&quot; term 
	was incorrectly using &quot;0.000138*Tsquared&quot; when calculating "zeta". 
	Thanks to Erik Grosse for reporting this bug. The errors were so small that 
	the values from the worked example of 21.b from the book ended up giving the 
	same results. If a longer timespan was used for the example instead of the 28 
	years then the errors would have been easier to spot with the incorrect terms.</li>
	<li>Updated the observed DeltaT values from <a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data">http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data</a> to 1st October 2014.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>v1.60 (29 March 2015</strong>)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details. </li>
	<li>Updates to the html documentation to clarify the units used in some of 
	the CAACoordinateTransaction methods. Thanks to &quot;Forrest&quot; for reporting 
	these issues.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>v1.61 (5 July 2015</strong>)</p>
<ul>
	<li>U1 (the Saturnicentric longitude of the Sun) and U2 (the Saturnicentic 
	longitude of the Earth) are now returned in CAASaturnRings::Calculate. </li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the calculation of CAASaturnRingDetails::DeltaU in the 
	method CAASaturnRings::Calculate where for some date ranges the value would 
	end up greater than 180 degrees. The book indicates that this value should 
	never be more than 7 degrees. The issue was related to subtraction of two 
	angles to obtain an absolute elongation value between the two. By definition 
	this value should never be greater than 180 degrees. The bug occurred 
	between the dates of June 3rd 2024 and July 28th 2024 and December 1st 2024 
	and February 12 2025. Thanks to Frank Vergeest for reporting this bug. </li>
	<li>Updated the observed DeltaT values from

</ul>
<p><strong>v1.62 (12 July 2015</strong>)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CAAElliptical::Calculate when calculating values for the 
	position of the Sun. The values returned by this method are now consistent 
	with those returned using the methods of the CAASun class, the planetarium 
	program SkyMap and the JPL HORIZON's web site. The errors were of the order 
	of 4 arc seconds in declination and 1.5 seconds of Right ascension for 
	modern times. I have also taken the opportunity to optimize the code in this 
	method. With these changes the errors are now down to 0.5 seconds of an 
	angle in declination and right ascension. Thanks to Marko Peric for 
	reporting this bug. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.63 (16 September 2015</strong>)</p>
<ul>
	<li>AA+ now includes complete support for the VSOP87 theory (<a href="ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VI/81/">ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VI/81/</a>) 
	in addition to the truncated VSOP87 theory as presented in Meeus's book. 
	This theory is used throughout the AA+ codebase to calculate the positions 
	of the planets and the Sun. The full VSOP87 theory is implemented by the new 
	AAVSOP*.cpp/h files included in the AA+ download. For a good introduction to 
	VSOP87, please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSOP_(planets)">
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSOP_%28planets%29</a>. The classes in AA+ to 
	support VSOP87 have been machine generated by parsing the VSOP87 files with 
	a custom C++ app to generate the new header and source modules. The results 
	have been comprehensively spot checked against the VSOP87 test values 
	provided in the &quot;vsop87.chk&quot; file in the VSOP87 files. Each VSOP theory 
	(VSOP87, VSOP87A, VSOP87B, VSOP87C, VSOP87D, &amp; VSOP87E) for each of the 
	objects (Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Earth-Moon Barycenter, Mars, Jupiter, 
	Saturn, Uranus &amp; Neptune) are implemented in separate header and source 
	modules so client applications can decide which modules to include. The 
	existing AA+ codebase will now optionally call into these new modules as 
	required. With this addition AA+ has gone from 840 Kilobytes and 16 thousand 
	lines of C++ source code library to 20 Megabytes and 291 thousand lines of a 
	C++ source code library. In one fell swoop I have almost doubled the amount 
	of open source code I distribute on my web site. Please note that if you 
	want to compile AA+ to not pull in a dependency on the new and quite large 
	VSOP87 modules, then you can define the preprocessor value 
	&quot;AAPLUS_VSOP87_NO_HIGH_PRECISION&quot; in your project. This will revert the AA+ 
	classes to just depend on the truncated VSOP87 theory as presented in 
	Meeus's book. </li>

<p>A class containing</p>

<p><i>Rise</i> The time in decimal hours when the object rises</p>
<p><i>bTransitAboveHorizon</i> true if the object transits above the horizon, false

<p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>
<p><i>JD </i>The Julian Day corresponding to that midnight Dynamical Time for the 
date when you want to perform the calculation.<i>&nbsp; </i></p>
<p><i>Alpha1 </i>The right ascension in hours of the object at time JD - 1 day</p>
<p><i>Delta1 </i>The declination in degrees of the object at time JD - 1 day</p>
<p><i>Alpha2 </i>The right ascension in hours of the object at time JD</p>

<p><i>Longitude </i>The geographic longitude of the observer in degrees.</p>
<p><i>Latitude</i> The geographic latitude of the observer in degrees.</p>
<p><i>h0 </i>The &quot;standard&quot; altitude in degrees i.e. the geometric altitude 
of the centre of the body at the time of the apparent rising or setting. For stars 
and planets, you would normally use -0.5667, for the Sun you would use -0.8333 and 
for the moon you would use 0.7275 * PI - 0.5666 where PI is the Moon&#39;s horizontal 
parallax in degrees (If no great accuracy is required, the mean value of h0 = 0.125 
can be used).</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong></p>
<p>Bear in mind that the times calculated for the phenomena are for the same UTC 
date. This means that when you are in a non GMT timezone, the calculated local times 
can be for the previous or next day. Please bear this issue in mind if you are generating 
an ephemeris of rise, transit and set times for a celestial object for a specific 
range of local dates. In this case, you will need to rerun the calculation for the 
previous or next UTC date if the calculated local date is not the same as the required 
local date.</p>
<p>Another wrinkle to how this method operates is that the same event can occur 
twice in the same day, even though this method does not provide a method to allow 
this to be easily obtained. For example, imagine you are located in the timezone 
PDT which is 4 hours behind GMT and you are calculating the times of sunset during 
the month of August, when PDT would be in effect. During this period, the length 
of the day is gradually reducing and the time of sunrise is getting earlier every 
day. Combined with the fact that calculated time of Sunset for this period is around 
20:00 local time or midnight UTC, you get this interesting effect where Sunrise 
occurs just around midnight UTC and then again just before midnight the following 
day! If you use the following code:</p>

</dl>
<p>Your client code which uses this method will need to handle this situation itself.</p>
<p>Another issue with the algorithm is that under certain circumstances, the time 
of an event (rise, transit or set) can be returned outside of the requested UTC 
day. For example if you request the times of moon rise, set and transit for Cape 
Town, South Africa on the 31st of October 2012 UTC you will get the following:<br>
<br>Rise (UTC): 2012-10-31 18:53:12<br>Transit (UTC): 2012-11-1 00:06:27<br>Set 
(UTC): 2012-10-31 04:35:24<br><br>Note how the transit time is for the next UTC 
day. If you were to run for the same location but for the date of 30th October 2012 
UTC you would get the following:<br><br>Rise (UTC): 2012-10-30 17:59:48<br>Transit 
(UTC): 2012-10-30 23:19:04<br>Set (UTC): 2012-10-30 03:56:19<br><br>Because the 
Moon takes roughly 45 minutes extra each day to return to the same position you 
see that the Moon did not actually transit on the UTC day of 31st of October 2012 
from Cape Town. Client code should bear this in mind when generating an ephemeris 
of times for a particular object.</p>
