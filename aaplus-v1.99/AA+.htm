<h2>AA+ v1.99</h2>
<p>Welcome to <b>AA+</b>, a collection of freeware C++ classes which provide 
an implementation of the algorithms as presented in the book &quot;Astronomical 
Algorithms&quot; (2nd Edition) by Jean Meeus.</p>
<p>Example areas covered include the positions of the planets, comets, minor planets 
and the moon, calculation of times of Rising, Setting and Transit, calculation of 
times of Equinoxes and Solstices plus calculation of the positions of the moons 
of Jupiter and Saturn as well as many other algorithms presented in the book.</p>

	when calculating &quot;sigma&quot;. Thanks to Michael McLaughlin for reporting this 
	bug. The errors were so small that the values from the worked example of 
	21.b from the book ended up giving the same results. If a longer timespan 
	was used for the example instead of the 28 years then the errors would have 
	been easier to spot from the incorrect terms. Hopefully this is the last

</ul>
<p><b>v1.90 (30 July 2017)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>AA+ now includes complete support for the ELP/MPP02 theory (<a href="ftp://cyrano-se.obspm.fr/pub/2_lunar_solutions/2_elpmpp02/">ftp://cyrano-se.obspm.fr/pub/2_lunar_solutions/2_elpmpp02/</a>) 
	in addition to the ELP2000-82B theory (<a href="http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?VI/79/">http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?VI/79/</a>) 
	and truncated ELP2000 theory as presented in Meeus's book. 
	This theory is the most up to date version of the ELP Lunar theory. It 
	includes fits to the JPL Ephemerides of DE405 &amp; DE406, LLR (Lunar Laser 
	Ranging) as well as the Nominal model used in ELP/MPP02. The full ELP/MPP02 theory is implemented by the new 
	AAELPMPP02.cpp/h files included in the AA+ download. This new class in AA+ to 
	support ELP/MPP02 has been machine generated by parsing the ELP/MPP02 files with 
	a custom C++ app to generate the new header and source modules. The results 
	have been comprehensively spot checked against the ELP/MPP02 test values 
	provided in the ELP/MPP02 files. The AA+ implementation is based in part 
	on a C# implementation of the theory at
	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astromony/files/">
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/astromony/files/</a> as well as a C 
	implementation in GAL (General Astrodynamics Library) by Paul Willmott at
	<a href="http://www.amsat-bda.org/GAL_Home.html">
	http://www.amsat-bda.org/GAL_Home.html</a>. Similar to the ELP2000-82b theory the results 
	are returned in the 
	equator and equinox of J2000. Client code is free to use the CAAPrecession class to 
	precess the coordinates to the required reference frame. Please note that if you 
	want to compile AA+ to not pull in a dependency on the new and quite large 
	ELP/MPP02 module, then you can define the preprocessor value 
	&quot;AAPLUS_NO_ELPMPP02&quot; in your project. With this 
	addition AA+ is now 27.7 Megabytes and 377 thousand lines of C++ source 
	code. Testing shows the time taken to call 
	CAAELP2000::EclipticRectangularCoordinatesJ2000 on my 3.2GHz Core i7 
	processor is about c. 1ms while the call to the new 
	CAAELPMPP02::EclipticRectangularCoordinatesJ2000 method including returning 
	the derivatives takes c. 5ms. From 
	the ELP/MPP02 paper, the longitude and latitude is three times more accurate 
	than ELP200-82B and the distance is eight times more accurate. For the 
	interval +1950 to +2060, there is reported accuracy of 0.06 arc seconds in 
	longitude, 0.003 arc seconds in latitude and 4 meters in distance.</li>
	<li>Updated the observed DeltaT values from
	<a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data">

	<li>Removed unnecessary SECOND_2_RAD define in AAELP2000.cpp module.</li>
	<li>Updated various CAAELP2000 methods to use &quot;const&quot; parameters.</li>
</ul><p><b>v1.80 (15 May 2017)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue in CAAPhysicalSun::Calculate where the value &quot;eta&quot; 
	would sometimes not be returned in the correct quadrant. Thanks to Alexandru 
	Garofide for reporting this issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.79 (27 April 2017)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Revisited the fix for interpolating RA values in the 
	CAARiseTransitSet class which was made on 28 March 2009. This new fix should 
	resolve this issue for good. Thanks to Gudni G. Sigurdsson for reporting 
	this bug. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>23 April 2017</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the documentation for CAAPrecession::AdjustPositionUsingMotionInSpace to clarify 
	the units used. Thanks to Matthew Prowse for reporting this issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.78 (19 February 2017)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the CAADynamicalTime::UTC2TT &amp; 
	CAADynamicalTime::TT2UTC methods where the code would incorrectly use 
	BaseMJD instead of JD when determining if the date is in the valid range of 
	UTC. Thanks to Luigi Candurro for reporting this bug. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.77 (18 February 2017)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a transcription error on the DeltaT value for 1 May 2015. The 
	correct value is 67.8012 instead of 67.8011. Thanks to Luigi Candurro for 
	reporting this error. </li>
	<li>Fixed a number of transcription errors on the predicted DeltaT values 
	from 2019.75 to 2025.75. Thanks to Luigi Candurro for reporting these 
	errors.</li>
	<li>CAADynamicalTime::TT2UTC is now implemented as TT2UT1 for date ranges 
	prior to 1 January 1961 and 500 days after the last leap second (which is 
	currently 1 January 2017). Also CAADynamicalTime::UTC2TT is now implemented 
	as UT12TT for date ranges prior to 1 January 1961 and 500 days after the 
	last leap second. These changes address problems where these two methods 
	would end up using a constant offset between UTC and TT for dates away from 
	the current epoch. This problem was discovered while calculating rise, 
	transit and set times for the Moon in B.C.E years. Thanks to Luigi Candurro 
	for prompting this update.</li>
	<li>Reworked the CAADate::SetInGregorianCalendar method to use the 
	AfterPapalReform method.</li>
	<li>Documentation now includes info on CAADate::AfterPapalReform methods. 
	Thanks to Luigi Candurro for reporting this issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.76 (12 February 2017)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a copy and paste bug in CAASaturnMoons::CalculateHelper in the 
	calculation of the value mu for the eight moon (Iapetus). Thanks to Cedric 
	Foellmi for reporting this issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.75 (11 February 2017)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Applied a bug fix to CAAMoon::EclipticLatitude and 
	CAAMoon::RadiusVector along the same lines as the fix to 
	CAAMoon::EclipticLongitude on February 2009. The bug fix should in fact have 
	been applied to the later two methods. Thanks to Jeffrey Roe for reporting 
	this issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.74 (5 February 2017)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details. </li>
	<li>Updated the observed DeltaT values from
	<a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data">
	http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data</a> to 1st January 2017 </li>

	http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.preds</a> to Jan 2026 </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.73 (16 October 2016)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Improved the accuracy of CAASun::ApparentEclipticLongitude when the 
	bHighPrecision parameter is true. The code now uses a new 
	VariationGeometricEclipticLongitude method which provides a new higher 
	precision method to calculate the effect of aberration. This takes into 
	account that Earth's orbit around the Sun is not a purely unperturbed 
	elliptical orbit. This improves the accuracy of the sample 25.a/b from the 
	book by a couple of hundreds of arc seconds. The results now are exactly in 
	sync with the results as reported in the book. Thanks to &quot;Pavel&quot; for 
	reporting this issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.72 (7 July 2016)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the documentation for the Alpha and Delta parameters to 
	the CAAPrecession::PrecessEquatorial method. Thanks to &quot;Luigi&quot; for reporting 
	this issue.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the documentation for the PMAlpha parameter to the 
	CAAPrecession::AdjustPositionUsingMotionInSpace method. Thanks to &quot;Luigi&quot; 
	for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Updated the CAADynamicalTime::CumulativeLeapSeconds method as taken from
	<a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat">
	http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat</a> 
	to include the leap second which will occur on 1 January 2017.</li>
	<li>Updated the observed DeltaT values from <a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data">http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data</a>

	<li>Fixed a compiler warning in CAAEaster::Calculate as reported at
	<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2348415/objective-c-astronomy-library">
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2348415/objective-c-astronomy-library</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.71 (28 April 2016)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the AAVSOP87 modules where an incorrect value was 
	being passed for the &quot;nTableSize&quot; parameter to the CVSOP87::Calculate and 
	CVSOP87::Calculate_Dash methods. A spot check of the VSOP87 sample values in 
	AATest.cpp now match exactly with the published VSOP87 test values. Thanks 
	to &quot;Pavel&quot; for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.70 (10 April 2016)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the GetSunRiseTransitSet function in the AATest.cpp 
	module where it incorrectly used Terrestrial Time instead of UTC. The error 
	in the rise / transit / set times was roughly the difference between TT and 
	UTC at the time of calculation. For the examples in AATest.cpp which 
	corresponded to October 2010, DeltaT was 67 seconds. A spot check of the AA+ code against SkyMap now shows both return the same times accurate to 
	the minute. Thanks to &quot;Pavel&quot; for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the GetMoonRiseTransitSet function in the AATest.cpp 
	module where it incorrectly used Terrestrial Time instead of UTC. The error 
	in the rise / transit / set times was roughly the difference between TT and 
	UTC at the time of calculation. For the examples in AATest.cpp which

	the AA+ code against SkyMap now shows both return the same times accurate to 
	the minute. Thanks to &quot;Pavel&quot; for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Introduction of a new bool CAARiseTransitSetDetails::bTransitValid 
	member variable. It turns out that celestial objects do not always transit 
	in a 24 hour UTC day. Test code has been added to AATest.cpp to fully 
	exercise all the cases for the three boolean member variables of 
	bRiseValid, bTransitValid &amp; bSetValid. Thanks to &quot;Pavel&quot; for reporting this 
	issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.69 (28 March 2016)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed two transcription errors in CAAMoonNodes::PassageThroNode. The 
	first error was the calculation of the D4 local variable which represented 
	4D in Meeus's formulae while the second error was in the -E*0.0003*sin(2D - 
	2M) coefficient. With these two fixes the calculated time of Example 51.a 
	from Meeus's book is within 2 seconds of the value he reports. Thanks to 
	Alejandro Krohn for prompting this bug fix.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.68 (27 March 2016)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated CAAEclipses::Calculate to return a bitmask of attributes about 
	the calculated solar eclipse in CAASolarEclipseDetails::Details. These 
	attributes correspond to the values as discussed in Meeus's book on Pages 
	381 &amp; 382. Thanks to &quot;Pavel&quot; for providing this nice addition. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.67 (20 March 2016)</b></p>

	declination. </li>
	<li>CAAPrecession::AdjustPositionUsingMotionInSpace now ensures that 
	the return value is in the normalized range for right ascension and

	<li>CAAPrecession::PrecessEquatorial now ensures that the return value 
	is in the normalized range for right ascension and declination. </li>
	<li>CAAPrecession::PrecessEquatorialFK4 now ensures that the return value is 
	in the normalized range for right ascension and declination. </li>
	<li>CAAPrecession::PrecessEcliptic now ensures that the return value is in 
	the normalized range for ecliptic longitude and latitude. </li>
	<li>CAAPrecession::PrecessEquatorialFK4 now adds the Equinox correction to 
	the returned right ascension. Thanks to &quot;Pavel&quot; for reporting this issue. </li>
	<li>Optimized the code in CAAPrecession::PrecessEquatorial, 
	CAAPrecession::PrecessEquatorialFK4 &amp; CAAPrecession::PrecessEcliptic. </li>
	<li> Updated the documentation for CAAPrecession::PrecessEquatorialFK4 to be 
	explicit on what coordinate system the parameters and return value are 
	defined in. Thanks to &quot;Pavel&quot; for reporting this issue. </li>
	<li>Fixed a transcription error in the CAAGlobe::RhoSinThetaPrime and 
	CAAGlobe::RhoCosThetaPrime functions. The value 6378149 was being used 
	instead of the correct value 6378140. Thanks to &quot;Pavel&quot; for reporting this 
	bug. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.66 (9 March 2016)</b></p>

	of the Moon. The full ELP2000-82b theory is implemented by the new 
	AAELP2000.cpp/h files included in the AA+ download. This new class in AA+ to 
	support ELP2000-82b has been machine generated by parsing the ELP2000-82b files with 
	a custom C++ app to generate the new header and source modules. The results 
	have been comprehensively spot checked against the ELP2000-82b test values 
	provided in the ELP2000-82b files. The AA+ implementation is based in part 
	on a C translation of the original Fortran source code included with 
	ELP2000-82b as well as the <a href="http://libnova.sourceforge.net/">Libnova</a> 
	open source library. As the ELP2000-82b theory returns the results in the 
	equator and equinox of J2000 / FK5 they cannot be directly integrated into 
	the existing CAAMoon class which returns the values in the equator and 
	equinox of the date. Client code is free to use the CAAPrecession class to 
	precess the coordinates to the required reference frame. Please note that if you 
	want to compile AA+ to not pull in a dependency on the new and quite large 
	ELP2000-82b module, then you can define the preprocessor value 
	&quot;AAPLUS_ELP2000_NO_HIGH_PRECISION&quot; in your project. With this 
	addition AA+ is now 23.6 Megabytes and 330 thousand lines of C++ source 
	code.</li>

	<li>AA+ now includes complete support for the VSOP87 theory (<a href="ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VI/81/">ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VI/81/</a>) 
	in addition to the truncated VSOP87 theory as presented in Meeus's book. 
	This theory is used throughout the AA+ codebase to calculate the positions 
	of the planets and the Sun. The full VSOP87 theory is implemented by the new 
	AAVSOP*.cpp/h files included in the AA+ download. For a good introduction to 
	VSOP87, please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSOP_(planets)">
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSOP_%28planets%29</a>. The classes in AA+ to 
	support VSOP87 have been machine generated by parsing the VSOP87 files with 
	a custom C++ app to generate the new header and source modules. The results 
	have been comprehensively spot checked against the VSOP87 test values 
	provided in the &quot;vsop87.chk&quot; file in the VSOP87 files. Each VSOP theory 
	(VSOP87, VSOP87A, VSOP87B, VSOP87C, VSOP87D, &amp; VSOP87E) for each of the 
	objects (Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Earth-Moon Barycenter, Mars, Jupiter, 
	Saturn, Uranus &amp; Neptune) are implemented in separate header and source 
	modules so client applications can decide which modules to include. The 
	existing AA+ codebase will now optionally call into these new modules as 
	required. With this addition AA+ has gone from 840 Kilobytes and 16 thousand 
	lines of C++ source code library to 20 Megabytes and 291 thousand lines of a 
	C++ source code library. In one fell swoop I have almost doubled the amount 
	of open source code I distribute on my web site. Please note that if you 
	want to compile AA+ to not pull in a dependency on the new and quite large 
	VSOP87 modules, then you can define the preprocessor value 
	&quot;AAPLUS_VSOP87_NO_HIGH_PRECISION&quot; in your project. This will revert the AA+

	seconds which have been applied to this point. For more information about leap 
	seconds please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second</a>. 
	Using this method you can now implement code which converts from Terrestrial 
	Time to Coordinated Universal time as follows: <br><br><code>double TerrestialTime 
	= some calculation using AA+ algorithms(JD); <br>double DeltaT = CAADynamicalTime::DeltaT(JD);
	<br>double UniversalTime1 = TerrestialTime - DeltaT/86400.0; //The time of the 
	event using the UT1 time scale <br>double TerrestialAtomicTime = TerrestialTime 
	- (32.184/86400.0); //The time of the event using the TAI time scale <br>double 
	CumulativeLeapSeconds = CAADynamicalTime::CumulativeLeapSeconds(JD); <br>double 
	CoordinatedUniversalTime = (DeltaT - CumulativeLeapSeconds - 32.184)/86400.0 
	+ UniversalTime1; //The time of the event using the UTC time scale</code></li>
</ul>

	<li>Updated CAARiseTransitSet::Calculate method to return information for circumpolar 
	object rather than returning bValid = false for this type of object. In the 
	case of a circumpolar object, the object does not rise or set on the day in 
	question but will of course transit at a specific time. This change means that 
	you do not need to recall the method with a declination value to get the transit 
	time. In addition if an object never rises or sets, the method will still return 
	the transit time even though it occurs below the horizon by setting the bTransitAboveHorizon 
	value to false. Note that this means that the &quot;Transit&quot; value will 
	now always include a valid value. Also the method has been renamed to Calculate.

	30 of the second edition. Basically when interpolating RA, we need to be careful 
	that the 3 values are consistent with respect to each other when any one of 
	them wraps around from 23H 59M 59S around to 0H 0M 0S. In this case, the RA

</ul>
<p><b>v1.34 (12 February 2009)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a seemingly copy and paste bug in CAAMoon::EclipticLongitude. The 
	layout of the code to calculate the &quot;ThisSigma&quot; value was incorrect. 
	The terms involving any value of M was being multiplied by E. This was incorrect 
	as documented at the bottom of page 338 from the second edition of Meeus&#39;s 
	book. The correct logic is to multiple only terms which involve +1M or -1M by 
	E and to multiple any terms which involved 2M or -2M by E*E. With the bug fixed 
	the worked example 47.a from the book now gives: 133.16726428105474 degrees. 
	This is a much closer result to the value as reported in the book which is 133.167265. 
	The previous buggy code was giving the value of 133.16726382897039 degrees for 
	the Moons apparent Longitude. The error in this example is 0.001627 arc seconds 
	of a degree. This error value is well within the actual reported accuracy of 
	10 arc seconds for the code, but you would expect this error to increase as 
	the eccentricity of earths orbit increases. Thanks to Neoklis Kyriazis for reporting 
	this bug.</li>

<p><b>v1.33 (7 February 2009)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a seemingly copy and paste bug in CAAMoonPerigeeApogee::TruePerigee. 
	The layout of the code to accumulate the &quot;Sigma&quot; value was incorrect. 
	The terms involving T (e.g. +0.00019*T, -0.00013*T etc were adding these terms 
	to the argument of the sin incorrectly. With the bug fixed the worked example 
	50.a from the book gives: 2447442.3543003569 JDE or 1988 October 7 at 20h:30m:11.5 
	seconds. The previous buggy code was giving the same value of 2447442.3543003569, 
	but this would be the case because T was a small value in the example. You would 
	expect the error in the calculated to be bigger as the date departs from the 
	Epoch 2000.0. Thanks to Neoklis Kyriazis for reporting this bug.</li>

<p><b>v1.29 (26 January 2007)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>After a bug report from Ing. Taras Kapuszczak that a round trip of the date 
	25 January 100 as specified in the Gregorian calendar to the Julian day number 
	and then back again produces the incorrect date 26 January 100, I&#39;ve spent 
	some time looking into the 2 key Meeus Julian Day algorithms. It seems that 
	the algorithms which converts from a Calendar date to JD works ok for propalactive 
	dates, but the reverse algorithm which converts from a JD to a Calendar date 
	does not. Since I made the change in behaviour to support propalactive Gregorian 
	dates to address issues with the Moslem calendar (and since then I have discovered 
	further unresolved bugs in the Moslem calendar algorithms and advised people 
	to check out my <a href="http://www.naughter.com/dtimeplus.html">DTime+</a> 
	library instead), I am now reverting these changes so that the date algorithms 
	are now as presented in Meeus&#39;s book. This means that dates after 15 October 
	1582 are assumed to be in the Gregorian calendar and dates before are assumed 
	to be in the Julian calendar. This change also means that some of the CAADate 
	class methods no longer require the now defunct &quot;bool&quot; parameter to 
	specify which calendar the date represents. As part of the testing for this 
	release verification code has been added to AATest.cpp to test all the dates 
	from JD 0 (i.e. 1 January -4712) to a date long in the future. Hopefully with 
	this verification code, we should have no more reported issues with the class 
	CAADate. Again if you would prefer a much more robust and comprehensive Date 
	time class framework, don&#39;t forget to check out the authors
	<a href="http://www.naughter.com/dtimeplus.html">DTime+</a> library.</li>
	<li>Optimized CAADate constructor code </li>
	<li>Provided a static version of CAADate::DaysInMonth() method</li>
	<li>Discovered an issue in CAADate::JulianToGregorian. It seems the algorithm 
	presented in the book to do conversion from the Julian to Gregorian calendar 
	fails for Julian dates before the Gregorian calendar reform in 1582. I have 
	sent an email to Jean Meeus to find out if this is a bug in my code or a deficiency 
	in the algorithm presented. Currently the code will assert in this function 
	if it is called for a date before the Gregorian reform.</li>

	<li>Fixed a bug where CAAEclipticalElements::Calculate and CAAEclipticalElements::FK4B1950ToFK5J2000 
	would return the incorrect value for the reduced inclination when the initial 
	inclination value was &gt; 90 degrees.</li>
	<li>Addition of a new module called CAANearParabolic. This new class provides 
	functionality for orbits which can be best modelled as near parabolic i.e. where 
	the eccentricity is between 0.98 and 1.02. Chapter 35 in the book includes support 
	for calculating Near-parabolic orbits, but the code is provided in BASIC and 
	the algorithm as presented has problems converging when the eccentricity is 
	close to 1. Instead the algorithms used in this new module are based upon the 
	worked examples which Paul Schlyter has provided at

<p><b>v1.25 (5 June 2006)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CAAElliptical::Calculate(double JD, EllipticalObject object) 
	where the correction for nutation was incorrectly using the Mean obliquity of 
	the ecliptic instead of the true value. The results from the test program now 
	agree much more closely with the example Meeus provides which is the position 
	of Venus on 1992 Dec. 20 at 0h Dynamical Time. I&#39;ve also checked the positions 
	against the JPL Horizons web site and the agreement is much better. Because 
	the True obliquity of the Ecliptic is defined as the mean obliquity of the ecliptic 
	plus the nutation in obliquity, it is relatively easy to determine the magnitude 
	of error this was causing. From the chapter on Nutation in the book, and specifically 
	the table which gives the cosine coefficients for nutation in obliquity you 
	can see that the absolute worst case error would be the sum of the absolute 
	values of all of the coefficients and would have been c. 10 arc seconds of degree, 
	which is not a small amount!. This value would be an absolute worst case and 
	I would expect the average error value to be much much smaller (probably much 
	less than an arc second). Anyway the bug has now been fixed. Thanks to Patrick 
	Wong for pointing out this rather significant bug. </li>

<p><b>v1.15 (30 January 2005)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Replaced all usage of BOOL with bool to aid in cross compiler compatibility. 
	This also means that all occurrences of TRUE and FALSE are replaced with true 
	and false respectively. Thanks to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this issue.
	</li>
	<li>cmath header file is now used rather than math.h. Also if now does not use 
	the #pragma message text based on a define which is MS C specific. Again thanks 
	to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this issue. </li>
	<li>Now uses asssert instead of the MFC specific ASSERT. Again thanks to Mika 
	Heiskanen for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Addition of a new global header file &quot;AA+.h&quot; which allows you 
	to include all of the AA+ framework through one header.</li>
	<li>Code now use static_cast&#39;s rather than old C-style casts. Again thanks 
	to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Optimized some of the code in assert&#39;s which avoid unitialized variables 
	when build in release mode. Again thanks to Mika Heiskanen for reporting this 
	issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.14 (21 January 2005)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a small but important error in the function PhaseAngle(r, R, Delta). 
	The code was producing incorrect results and raises acos DOMAIN errors and floating 
	point exceptions when calculating phase angles for the inner planets. Thanks 
	to MICHAEL R. MEYER for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.13 (31 December 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix for CAAElliptical::MinorPlanetMagnitude where the phase angle was being 
	incorrectly converted from Radians to Degress when it was already in degrees. 
	Thanks to Martin Burri for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.12 (10 November 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix for CAADate::Get so that it works correctly for propalactive calendar 
	dates. The Meeus implementation automatically assumes the Gregorian Calendar 
	came into effect on 15 October 1582 (JD: 2299161), while the CAADate implementation 
	has a &quot;m_bGregorianCalendar&quot; value to decide if the date was specified 
	in the Gregorian or Julian Calendars. This difference means in effect that CAADate 
	fully supports propalactive versions of both calendar systems. This problem 
	was discovered when testing the Moslem calendar code which involves a round 
	trip between Moslem -&gt; Julian -&gt; Gregorian calendars. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.11 (15 October 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>bValid variable is now correctly set in CAARiseTransitSet::Calculate if the objects 
	does actually rise and sets.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.10 (17 September 2004)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a number of warnings in the code when compiled in VC .Net 2003 with 
	the &quot;Force conformance in For Loop Scope&quot; compiler option is set.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>6 September 2004</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minor update to the documentation plus a full spell check!!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.09 (15 June 2004)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a typo in the calculation of SunLongDash in CAAPhysicalSun::Calculate. 
	Thanks to Brian Orme for spotting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.08 (31 May 2004)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Added a missing coefficient to g_L1JupiterCoefficients array as used by 
	CAAJupiter::EclipticLongitude. Thanks to Brian Orme for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>Added missing g_B5JupiterCoefficients[] in CAAJupiter::EclipticLatitude. 
	Again thanks to Brian Orme for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>In CAASaturn::EclipticLongitude the g_L5SaturnCoefficients[] were not included. 
	Thanks to Brian Orme for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>In CAASaturn::EclipticLatitude the g_B5SaturnCoefficients[] were not included. 
	Thanks to Brian Orme for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>In CAASaturn::RadiusVector the g_R5SaturnCoefficients[] were not included. 
	Thanks to Brian Orme for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v1.07 (24 May 2004)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a missing break statement in CAAElliptical::Calculate. Thanks to Carsten 
	A. Arnholm for reporting this bug.</li>
	<li>Also fixed an issue with the calculation of the apparent distance to the 
	Sun.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>27 April 2004</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minor update to the documentation describing CAAElliptical::MeanMotionFromSemiMajorAxis</li>
</ul>
<p><b>V1.06 (22 February 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Calculation of semi durations for eclipses in CAAEclipses is now calculated 
	only when required</li>
</ul>
<p><b>V1.05 (22 February 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the calculation of the phase type from the k value in CAAMoonPhases::TruePhase.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>V1.04 (21 February 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>The optical libration in longitude for the moon is now returned in the range 
	-180 - 180 degrees</li>
</ul>
<p><b>V1.03 (14 February 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a &quot;minus zero&quot; bug in the function CAACoordinateTransformation::DMSToDegrees. 
	The sign of the value is now taken explicitly from the new bPositive boolean 
	parameter. Thanks to Patrick Wallace for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>V1.02 (9 February 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Replaced all calls to the macro &quot;INT&quot; with the function CAADate::INT 
	which is what they should have been. The only affected class for this was CAAMoslemCalendar.</li>
	<li>Fixed a number of level 4 warnings in the CAAStellarMagnitudes class when 
	the code is compiled in VC.Net 2003. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>V1.01 (9 February 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the values used in the calculation of the a1 and a2 constants for 
	Saturn&#39;s moon Rhea (satellite V) following an email from Jean Meeus confirming 
	that these constants are indeed incorrect as published in the book. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>V1.0 (6 February 2004)</b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Initial public release.</li>

<p><i>Alpha1 </i>The right ascension in hours of the object at time JD - 1 day</p>
<p><i>Delta1 </i>The declination in degrees of the object at time JD - 1 day</p>

<p><i>Longitude </i>The geographic longitude of the observer in degrees 
(Positive west, negative east from Greenwich)</p>
<p><i>Latitude</i> The geographic latitude of the observer in degrees.</p>
<p><i>h0 </i>The &quot;standard&quot; altitude in degrees i.e. the geometric altitude 
of the centre of the body at the time of the apparent rising or setting. For stars 
and planets, you would normally use -0.5667, for the Sun you would use -0.8333 and 
for the moon you would use 0.7275 * PI - 0.5666 where PI is the Moon&#39;s horizontal 
parallax in degrees (If no great accuracy is required, the mean value of h0 = 0.125 
can be used).</p>
<p><b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>Bear in mind that the times calculated for the phenomena are for the same UTC 
date. This means that when you are in a non GMT timezone, the calculated local times 
can be for the previous or next day. Please bear this issue in mind if you are generating 
an ephemeris of rise, transit and set times for a celestial object for a specific 
range of local dates. In this case, you will need to rerun the calculation for the 
previous or next UTC date if the calculated local date is not the same as the required 
local date.</p>
<p>Another wrinkle to how this method operates is that the same event can occur 
twice in the same day, even though this method does not provide a method to allow 
this to be easily obtained. For example, imagine you are located in the timezone 
PDT which is 4 hours behind GMT and you are calculating the times of sunset during 
the month of August, when PDT would be in effect. During this period, the length 
of the day is gradually reducing and the time of sunrise is getting earlier every 
day. Combined with the fact that the calculated time of Sunset for this period is around 
20:00 local time or midnight UTC, you get this interesting effect where Sunrise 
occurs just around midnight UTC and then again just before midnight the following 
day! If you use the following code:</p>
